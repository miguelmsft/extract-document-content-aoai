      "RequirementText": "Change Orders and/or Amendments\n\nThe Executive Director of DOM or designated representative may, at any time, by written order delivered to the Contractor at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement date of such change, make administrative changes within the general scope of the contract. If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of the performance of any part of the work under the contract an adjustment commensurate with the costs of performance under this contract shall be made in the contract price or delivery schedule or both. Any claim by the Contractor for equitable adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing to DOM within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by the Contractor of the notification of change. Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute within the meaning of the Dispute Clause of this Contract. Nothing in this case, however, shall in any manner excuse the Contractor from proceeding diligently with the contract as changed.\n\nIf the parties are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days of DOM receipt of the Contractor’s cost estimate, the Executive Director of DOM shall make a determination of the revised price, and the Contractor shall proceed with the work according to a schedule approved by DOM subject to the Contractor’s right to appeal the Executive Director’s determination of the price pursuant to the Disputes Section. Nothing in this clause shall in any manner excuse the Contractor from proceeding diligently with the contract as changed.\n\nThe rate of payment for changes or amendments completed per contract year shall be at the rates specified by the Contractor’s proposal.\n\nAt any time during the term of this contract, DOM may increase the quantity of goods or services purchased under this contract by sending the Contractor a written amendment or modification to that effect which references this contract and is signed by the Executive Director of DOM. The purchase price shall be the lower of the unit cost identified in the Contractor’s proposal or the Contractor’s then-current, published price. The foregoing shall not apply to services provided to DOM at no charge. The delivery schedule for any items added by exercise of this option shall be set by mutual agreement."
